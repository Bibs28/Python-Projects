## Project 1 : Expense Tracker  [View Expense Tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/Bibs28/Python-Projects/blob/5cfefe79be4fcfe4e042996bb112b62e5621839d/expense_tracker.py)

## Features

- **Add Expenses:** Users can add their expenses to the tracker by entering the date, description, and amount spent. The expenses are then stored and used for calculations.

- **View Expenses:** The application provides an option to view all the expenses listed with their respective dates and amounts.

- **View Disposable Income:** Users can check their disposable income, which is calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the entered income. If the disposable income is negative, the user will receive a helpful message suggesting that they slow down their spending.

- **Detailed Breakdown:** There is an additional option to view a detailed breakdown of all the listed expenses along with the disposable income.



## Project 2:  Slot Machine Game

Welcome to the Slot Machine Game! This is a simple text-based casino-style game developed in Python. The game allows you to try your luck by spinning the slot machine and matching symbols to win virtual coins.

## Instructions

1. Enter your desired initial balance when prompted to set up your custom starting point.
2. Place bets on each spin by entering the amount you want to wager. You can enter 0 to quit the game.
3. The slot machine consists of three spinning reels, each displaying one of six symbols: Cherry, Bell, Lemon, Orange, Star, and Skull.
4. If you get three matching symbols, you win based on the symbol's payout ratio. For example, getting three Cherries pays out 3 times your bet.
5. If you get two matching symbols, you receive your bet back.
6. If there are no matching symbols, you lose your bet.
7. The game continues until you decide to quit or until your balance runs out.

## Features

- Custom Initial Balance: You can set your preferred initial balance to start the game.
- Interactive Gameplay: The game prompts you to place bets and displays the result of each spin.
- Random Symbol Generation: The slot machine generates random symbols for each spin.
- Payout Calculations: The game calculates payouts based on the matched symbols and payout ratios.
