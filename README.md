## Introduction
## Welcome to my Python portfolio where I would have hopefully been able to demostrate and apply my knowledge of Python
- **If theres any feedback you can give to improve my current understanding and make my projects 

## Project 1 : Expense Tracker  [View Expense Tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/Bibs28/expense_tracker.py)

## Features

- **Add Expenses:** Users can add their expenses to the tracker by entering the date, description, and amount spent. The expenses are then stored and used for calculations.

- **View Expenses:** The application provides an option to view all the expenses listed with their respective dates and amounts.

- **View Disposable Income:** Users can check their disposable income, which is calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the entered income. If the disposable income is negative, the user will receive a helpful message suggesting that they slow down their spending.

- **Detailed Breakdown:** There is an additional option to view a detailed breakdown of all the listed expenses along with the disposable income.
